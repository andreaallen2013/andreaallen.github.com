<p><b>A brief background of myself: Texan born and raised. I attended film school in NYC and am avid reader and traveler. I have been to 28 of the 50 US states, 5 countries and am always willing to plan another trip. I’m a digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, accustomed to troubleshooting and supporting others in their usage of technology. I love to combine technology and traveling.

I've put these 21st Century super powers to good work, volunteering with NYCares to help out of work members of the community get comfortable interacting with computers. I have also worked with a diverse & expanding user base at Netflix. It’s enriching to help people and know your work contributes to their well being & enjoyment. </b></p>
