I attended New York Film Academy and my formal film training could be of help with multimedia needs in a range of industries. I worked for a small upstart publishing company in New York where I learned technical skills that could be of assistance too. Between copy writing, managing the social media accounts and producing all of their video content, I believe you'd find I have many skills in addition to customer service that would be a value to any organization.

I've combined a unique life-full of experiences, skills and lessons learned to reach my current destination. I've worked with customers and the general public in many ways from selling clothing, installing appliances, to producing video content and designing web sites for clients. From film school, to sales experiences, to server deployment and administration. These skills and qualities of mine, mixed with numerous life experiences, make me uniquely qualified. I've worked in many industries, including retail, where I learned much patience and communications skills working with the public. I believe these skills would transfer well to many positions.

I taught myself web design and system adminstration. A digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, I'm accustomed to troubleshooting and supporting others in their usage of technology. I have put these 21st Century super powers to good work, volunteering with NYC Cares to help older, out of work members of the community get accustom to interacting with computers. I met and helped train some amazing people to efficiently use computers in the workspace. It's enriching to help people and know your work contributes to their well being.
