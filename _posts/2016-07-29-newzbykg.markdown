A brief background of myself: Texan born and raised. I attended film school in NYC. Taught myself web design and system administration. Am an avid reader and skateboarder. A digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, I'm accustomed to troubleshooting and supporting others in their usage of technology. 

I have put these 21st Century super powers to good work, volunteering with NYC Cares to help older, out of work members of the community get comfortable interacting with computers. I met and helped train some amazing people to efficiently use computers in the workspace. It's enriching to help people and know your work contributes to their well being.  

I have numerous experiences with the public from selling clothing, installing appliances, to producing video content and designing web sites for clients. These skills and qualities of mine, mixed with numerous life experiences, make me uniquely qualified. I have had to manage expectations, assure clients, identify and resolve their issues all while communicating in a clear, concise manner; thus providing an overall great experience.

I'm formally trained in the arts at New York Film Academy and have worked for a small publishing company in New York where I learned technical skills like: copy writing, managing the social media accounts, producing video content. Also honed many media and technical skills working for independent clients and contracts.
