A brief background of myself: Texan born and raised. I attended film school in NYC and am avid reader and traveler. I have been to 28 of the 50 US states, 5 countries and am always willing to plan another trip. I’m a digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, accustomed to troubleshooting and supporting others in their usage of technology. I love to combine technology and traveling.

I have put these 21st Century super powers to good work, volunteering with NYCares to help older, out of work members of the community get comfortable interacting with computers. I have also worked with a diverse and expanding user base at Netflix. It’s enriching to help people and know your work contributes to their well being. This ability to make a difference and effect people directly is what draws me to this line of work.

I have numerous other experiences with the public from customer and technical support, billing and sells, to producing video content and designing web sites for clients. These skills and qualities of mine, mixed with numerous life experiences, make me uniquely qualified. I have had to manage expectations, assure clients, identify and resolve their issues all while communicating in a clear, concise manner; thus providing an overall great experience.

I'm formally trained in the arts at New York Film Academy and have worked for a small publishing company in New York where I learned technical skills like: copy writing, managing social media accounts and, producing web content. Also, I honed many media and technical skills working for independent clients and contracts. I have 5 plus years of customer support experience with companies like Lowe's, MPower Electric and Netflix, nearly 2 years of driving with a spotless record. 

I've learned and adapted to use a wide range of tools, including: FedEx Ship Manager. UPS WorldShip. Netsuite inventory and sales management. Netflix's custom CRM bug tracker and help desk. Microsoft Windows, Office, & Internet Explorer. Avid Pro Tools. Apple macOS, iOS, Final Cut, Logic & Safari. Adobe Creative Suite. Google Chrome, Search & Android.
