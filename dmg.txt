Hello,

Thank you for contacting us and I am sorry to hear about your issues on your Mac.  I can see that you currently still have our older, unsupported Mac version installed. It does seem like the old version is interfering with the Mac connection. Fear not, it is an easy fix. Just follow the steps below:

**Please note: Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite or Higher is required to continue using Hotspot Shield with your Mac. For help updating, [follow Apple's support article.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) If you are unable to update you can still use [Hotspot Shield for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/Hotspot-shield-free-vpn-p/nlbejmccbhkncgokjcmghpfloaajcffj) or [Hotspot Shield for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/Hotspot-shield-elite-vpn-proxy/)**

#### First, uninstall any and all versions installed following these steps:  
* Go to the Finder sidebar, click **Applications**. Drag any and all versions of the Hotspot Shield app from the Applications folder to the **Trash** (located at the end of the Dock), then Empty Trash.

#### Next Open **System Preferences** or **System Settings.**  
* Double click on **Networks**
* Select "Hotspot Shield VPN" from the left side and click "-" (minus) symbol on the left bottom side.
* Click on "Apply" and close the settings.

#### If you receive a message that the application is open, please do the following:  
1. Click on the Shield icon to open the app window
2. Click on **pause protection**
3. On the upper left corner, you will see the **X** button to close the app.

Then you can remove Hotspot Shield as initially explained.

#### Then, remove cookies and cache in your web browser(s):  
* Chrome: Chrome menu>Preferences>Show Advanced Settings>Clear Browsing Data
* Safari: Safari menu>Preferences>Privacy>Remove All Website Data
* Firefox: Firefox menu>Preferences>Privacy>Remove individual cookies

#### Restart your Mac device and install the latest version from the Mac App store [available here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/Hotspot-shield-vpn-best-vpn/id771076721?mt=12).  
* Finally try to browse the internet with Hotspot Shield turned **ON**

If you have any questions about our Mac app, issues uninstalling, or need any further assistance, please let me know.

Kind regards,
