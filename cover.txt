Hello and good day. Thank you for taking the time to read this. My name is Kevin but my friends call me KG.

A brief background of myself: I attended film school in NYC. Taught myself web design and system administration. Am a avid reader and explorer. A digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, I am accustom to supporting others in their use of technology.

I've worked with customers and the general public in many ways, from teaching classes on Microsoft Office, selling clothing and installing appliances, to producing video content and administering web sites for clients. I've had to manage customers expectations, communicate with them in a clear and concise way and provide an overall great experience and product. I have executed these skills over the phone, via e-mail and face to face. 

Currently I support a SaaS company with a Top 10 app in the App Store. I'm an intimate part of a small team delivering top notch email and chat support. I love technical issues and digging in deeper. I think this would qualify me as a great fit for your position. I have attached my resume below, I believe you will find I have tons of experience supporting users and a deep technical knowledge. 

Feel free to reach me by email at kg@kevingailey.com or via cell at (903) 948-8511. I hope to hear from you soon.

Kind Regards
